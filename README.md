### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **Saurav Nayal**, a software developer from India who loves building fast, scalable, and beautiful web experiences.

I design, build, break, rebuild — and ship whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, there’s a high chance I’ll turn it into a full-stack project by the end of the week.

My main tech stack is **Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, MongoDB, and shadcn/ui**.  
My favorite tools are **VS Code, GitHub, and Vercel**.

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorites are:  
- **[GhostGram](https://github.com/nayalsaurav/GhostGram)** – anonymous Q&A platform  
- **[AI360](https://github.com/nayalsaurav/ai360)** – modular AI productivity suite  

I’ve built dozens of public projects, but privately… probably 100+ more experiments, prototypes, and half-finished ideas.

If you want to see everything I’m building, check out **[nayalsaurav.tech](https://nayalsaurav.tech)**.
